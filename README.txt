# E1RM Calculator

The E1RM Calculator is a simple Python program that allows you to calculate the estimated one-repetition maximum (E1RM) for various exercises in weight training. In addition, the program offers a comparison function to see how your performance compares to other athletes.

## Installation

1. make sure that Python is installed on your computer. If not, you can download and install it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 2.

2. download the code for this project and unzip it if it is compressed

3. open the command line (terminal) on your computer

4. navigate to the directory where the downloaded code is located.

5. create a virtual Python environment (optional, but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate

On macOS and Linux: source myenv/bin/activate

Install the required dependencies (libraries and packages): pip install -r requirements.txt


How to use

Run the program by entering the following command in the command line: python main.py

The program starts and opens a graphical user interface (GUI). (This can take up to 10 seconds)

Select your gender, the type of exercise, the number of repetitions, the perceived exertion (RPE), the weight, your age and your weight class.

Click on the "Calculate" button to display the estimated E1RM value and comparison information.

Close the GUI window when you are done.


This project uses Python and various Python libraries to perform the calculations and provide the user interface. 
You need to make sure that Python is installed and the dependencies are installed as described in the installation guide.

The data for the comparison comes from an external data source and is defined in the code.
